## Arduino Installation

Download the Arduino IDE [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). It should be the first download button on the page.
Install it
and make sure it works:

- Open up the "Blink" sketch under example projects
  ![blink](./blink.png)
- Click the check button in the upper left (this makes sure you are able to
  verify/compile it) - TK this needs to select board first and plug in first.
